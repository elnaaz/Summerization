libya: contact group creates fund for rebels
the international contact group on libya has agreed to create a temporary fund to assist rebel groups, during talks in rome.
british foreign secretary william hague insisted that any financial assistance to the rebels would not be spent on weapons.
the move followed an urgent request from the rebels, based in the eastern city of benghazi.
speaking in rome, italian foreign minister franco frattini said the creation of a new financial mechanism would "permit funds to be channelled effectively and transparently" to the rebels.
the rebels' transitional national council says it needs $2bn-$3bn (£1.2bn-£1.8bn) in the coming months for military salaries, food, medicine and other basic supplies.
amid scenes of panic, families were separated and the ship had to re-dock twice before finally setting sail with mostly wounded people and stranded foreign workers.
"this [money] will help them to keep basic services going... because in the east of libya they still need to be educating people, to keep public services moving and they have to meet the expenses of all that and they don't have much tax revenue at the moment," he said.

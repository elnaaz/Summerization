Libya: Contact group creates fund for rebels
The international contact group on Libya has agreed to create a temporary fund to assist rebel groups, during talks in Rome.
The group of Nato countries, Arab states and other nations are discussing ways to increase pressure on Col Muammar Gaddafi.
Meanwhile, a ship has evacuated people from the besieged port of Misrata.
Speaking in Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the creation of a new financial mechanism would "permit funds to be channelled effectively and transparently" to the rebels.
The rebels' Transitional National Council says it needs $2bn-$3bn (£1.2bn-£1.8bn) in the coming months for military salaries, food, medicine and other basic supplies.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted that any financial assistance to the rebels would not be spent on weapons.
Mr Hague said efforts would also be made to explore how Col Gaddafi's government could be prevented from exporting oil or importing refined products.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US was trying to free more than $30bn it had frozen in Libyan assets.
Meanwhile the aid ship - Red Star - chartered by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), has managed to take 1,300 passengers to Benghazi, despite being hit by shellfire as it docked. Five people were killed.
Amid scenes of panic, families were separated and the ship had to re-dock twice before finally setting sail with mostly wounded people and stranded foreign workers.
Rebel forces in Libya hold much of the east of the country, around Benghazi, while Col Gaddafi holds most of the west.
Nato is enforcing a UN mandate to protect civilians caught in the conflict.

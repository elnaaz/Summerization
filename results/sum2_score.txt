dead stars provide einstein test
scientists have put einstein's theory of gravity to a remarkable test using two distant, dead stars.
einstein's theory of general relativity (gr) describes mass and gravity as being generated by the curvature of space-time.
einstein's theory predicts that the double pulsar system should be emitting gravitational waves - ripples in space-time that spread out across the universe at the speed of light - as the neutron stars gradually fall in on each other.
an international team studied a double pulsar system, a pair of dense neutron stars whose properties mean they act like near-perfect space clocks.
the results, reported in science, match einstein's predictions to within 0.05%.	
the astronomers observed the way each stellar timepiece behaved in the other's curved space-time to run the rule over general relativity.
professor kramer's team discovered the double pulsar system three years ago.
by monitoring the pulses' arrival at earth, the team was able to measure how the beams from each neutron star were being disturbed as they passed through the curved space-time near their companion.

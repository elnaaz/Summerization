<h1>Royal newly-weds to visit US after Canada tour</h1>
<h2>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to pay an official visit to the US following their first overseas tour to Canada this summer.</h2>
Prince William and his new wife will extend the trip with a three-day visit to California from 8-10 July, said their spokesman.
Announcing the visit on its Twitter page, Clarence House said a full itinerary would be published later.
It will be the first official visit to the US for the duke.
While the prince has previously visited the States in a private capacity, this will be the duchess's first trip to the country.
The prince returned to his job as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot this week after marrying the duchess on Friday at Westminster Abbey.
The couple spent their first weekend as a married couple at a secret location in the UK, and opted to postpone their honeymoon until a later date.
They will begin their first joint official overseas trip by touring Canada from 30 June to 8 July, including visits to Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the capital, Ottawa.
Speaking earlier this year Canadian PM Stephen Harper said it was a testament to Canada's "very close relationship with the Royal Family".
It is believed the couple will take part in Canada Day celebrations in Ottawa on 1 July.
William visited the Commonwealth country in 1998 aged 15, touring Vancouver with his father the Prince of Wales and brother Prince Harry.
The Queen visited Canada last July, and in 2009, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall spent 11 days there.

Call for thyroid screening in pregnancy
All pregnant women should be screened for hidden signs of thyroid disease, according to Czech researchers. 
A blood test can pick up about a third of mothers-to-be who have no symptoms but will go on to develop full-blown disease after giving birth, they say.
Early detection could have major implications for the health of mothers and babies, they told the European Congress of Endocrinology.
About half of these had no symptoms of thyroid problems but had tested positive for a marker in the blood that suggests they may be at future risk.About a third of these women went on to develop thyroid problems within two years of birth.

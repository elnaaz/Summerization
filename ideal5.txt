Royal newly-weds to visit US after Canada tour
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to pay an official visit to the US following their first overseas tour to Canada this summer.
Prince William and his new wife will extend the trip with a three-day visit to California from 8-10 July, said their spokesman.
It will be the first official visit to the US for the duke.
While the prince has previously visited the States in a private capacity, this will be the duchess's first trip to the country.

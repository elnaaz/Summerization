Dead stars provide Einstein test
Scientists have put Einstein's theory of gravity to a remarkable test using two distant, dead stars.
An international team studied a double pulsar system, a pair of dense neutron stars whose properties mean they act like near-perfect space clocks.
The astronomers observed the way each stellar timepiece behaved in the other's curved space-time to run the rule over General Relativity.
The results, reported in Science, match Einstein's predictions to within 0.05%.
Professor Kramer's team discovered the double pulsar system three years ago. 
By monitoring the pulses' arrival at Earth, the team was able to measure how the beams from each neutron star were being disturbed as they passed through the curved space-time near their companion.
Einstein's theory predicts that the double pulsar system should be emitting gravitational waves - ripples in space-time that spread out across the Universe at the speed of light - as the neutron stars gradually fall in on each other.
Einstein's ideas have stood up extremely well to almost 100 years of scientific scrutiny, but researchers recognise General Relativity is likely to need at least some revision as they seek to unify its description of the large-scale Universe with quantum mechanics, the ideas that explain the realm of sub-atomic particles.
In the future, the Kramer team hopes to use its stellar clocks to directly detect gravitational waves emitted by merging supermassive black holes.
As the waves pass through the curved space-time around a network of nearby pulsars, they should leave their tell-tale imprint in the radio beam signals received on Earth.

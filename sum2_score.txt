dead stars provide einstein test	25.52284542220199	
scientists have put einstein's theory of gravity to a remarkable test using two distant, dead stars.	22.539915602342848	
einstein's theory of general relativity (gr) describes mass and gravity as being generated by the curvature of space-time.	11.570776892068277	
einstein's theory predicts that the double pulsar system should be emitting gravitational waves - ripples in space-time that spread out across the universe at the speed of light - as the neutron stars gradually fall in on each other.	6.546833479901992	
an international team studied a double pulsar system, a pair of dense neutron stars whose properties mean they act like near-perfect space clocks.	7.693410268337176	
the results, reported in science, match einstein's predictions to within 0.05%.	3.8856985275838714	
the astronomers observed the way each stellar timepiece behaved in the other's curved space-time to run the rule over general relativity.	12.766051459593436	
professor kramer's team discovered the double pulsar system three years ago.	4.054714891505896	
by monitoring the pulses' arrival at earth, the team was able to measure how the beams from each neutron star were being disturbed as they passed through the curved space-time near their companion.	5.048797182732091
